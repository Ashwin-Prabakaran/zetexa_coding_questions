1. File Processing and Reporing :

import csv

csv_file = "file.csv"
csv_outfile = "user_totals.csv"
outdict = []

##transacƟon_id,user_id,amount,transacƟon_date
##Reading through the input csv
with open(csv_file) as f:
    for r in csv.DictReader(f):
        if outdict is None:
            outdict[int(r["user_id"])] = int(r["amount"])
        
        for key, value in outdict.items():
            if key == int(r["user_id"]):
                value += int(r["amount"])
            else:
                outdict[int(r["user_id"])] = int(r["amount"])
                
##Writing onto output csv
with open(csv_outfile, 'w', newline = '') as outfile:
    writer = csv.writer(csvfile)
    writer.writerows(outdict)
